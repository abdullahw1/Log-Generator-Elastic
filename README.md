# Log-Generator-Elastic
# Log Generator

This Python script generates and indexes logs into Elasticsearch. It uses the `elasticsearch` library to connect to Elasticsearch and `logging` module for logging purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Elasticsearch server running locally

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `log-gen.py` file.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:


## Usage

1. Make sure your Elasticsearch server is running locally on `http://localhost:9200`.

2. Open the `log-gen.py` file and configure the following variables if needed:

- `index_name`: The name of the Elasticsearch index where the logs will be stored.
- `num_logs`: The number of logs to generate and index.

3. Run the script using the following command:

4. The script will connect to Elasticsearch, generate the specified number of logs, and index them into the specified index.

## Notes

- If Elasticsearch is running on a different host or port, modify the `es` variable in the script to match your Elasticsearch configuration.

- The script uses the current timestamp for each log entry and a sequential log message. You can modify the log generation logic inside the `generate_logs` function according to your requirements.

- The logs generated by the script will be indexed into the specified Elasticsearch index. You can use Kibana or Elasticsearch APIs to search, analyze, and visualize the indexed logs.

- Make sure to enable Elasticsearch security features if you're running Elasticsearch in a production environment. Refer to the Elasticsearch documentation for more information.
